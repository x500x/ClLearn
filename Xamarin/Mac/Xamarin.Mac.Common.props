	<!-- Story-time! MigrateToNewXMIdentifier is special because it un-does a lie we started telling from the 
	beginning of Full (called Xamarin.Mac 4.5 back then). Back then, we released Modern (called Mobile) and 
	when many customers upgraded from Classic they broke in terrible ways as none of their nugets worked. 
	No nugets in the wild had heard of the Xamarin.Mac TFI and thus didn't support it. To "fix" this use case,
	we created Full (XM 4.5) and _lied_ with our TFI claiming to be .NETFramework. Well we were close enough
	for a vast majority of packages to work. However, this made creating Full specific package flavors impossible.
	Now that we're getting "real" nuget support, we need to stop lying without breaking the world. We're starting by
	allowing "opt-in" MigrateToNewXMIdentifier which will swap your declared TFI to the new hotness.
